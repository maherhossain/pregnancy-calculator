== Description ==

The Pregnancy Calculator can estimate a pregnancy schedule based on the provided due date. An estimated due date, usually based on a sonogram, is typically obtained from a health care provider during a prenatal visit. It is also possible to estimate the due date based on the biological cycle using the Due Date Calculator. You can calculate the Pregnancy by using Multiple Criteria.


== Pregnancy Calculator Features ==

This calculator may be used to calculate the best date range to book a Nuchal Translucency Scan and Morphology Scan :

1. NT scan may be performed between 11wks–13wks 6 days (CRL 45-84mm) however as individual babies grow slightly differently and to visualize the foetal bladder and heart the very best range is 12wks 3days to 13wks 3day
2. Morphology scan is best booked after 19wks but before 22wks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is my due date calculated? =

Your due date is calculated by adding 280 days (40 weeks) to the first day of your last menstrual period (assuming a 28-day cycle).

Note that your menstrual period and ovulation are counted as the first two weeks of pregnancy. If you deliver on your due date, your baby is actually only 38 weeks old, not 40.


= Is due date calculation effective? =

Please remember that your due date is only an estimate. Every pregnancy is unique and your baby will come when it's ready. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about your due date.

On average only 5% of births take place exactly on the estimated due date. Most are born within a week either side of the estimated due date. A normal pregnancy can last anywhere between 38 and 42 weeks.
